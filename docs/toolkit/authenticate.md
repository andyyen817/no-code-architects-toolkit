# `/v1/toolkit/authenticate` API Documentation

## Overview
This endpoint is used to authenticate a client by verifying the provided API key. It serves as a gatekeeper for accessing other protected endpoints within the application.

## Endpoint
- URL Path: `/v1/toolkit/authenticate`
- HTTP Method: `GET`

## Request

### Headers
- `X-API-Key` (required): The API key used for authentication.

### Body Parameters
This endpoint does not require any request body parameters.

### Example Request
```
curl -X GET \
  https://your-api-domain.com/v1/toolkit/authenticate \
  -H 'X-API-Key: your_api_key'
```

## Response

### Success Response
- Status Code: `200 OK`
- Response Body:
```json
"Authorized"
```

### Error Responses
- Status Code: `401 Unauthorized`
- Response Body:
```json
"Unauthorized"
```

## Error Handling
If the provided `X-API-Key` header does not match the expected API key, the endpoint will return a `401 Unauthorized` status code with the response body `"Unauthorized"`.

## Usage Notes
- This endpoint should be called before accessing any protected endpoints to ensure the client is authenticated.
- The API key should be kept secure and not shared with unauthorized parties.

## Common Issues
- Providing an incorrect or invalid API key will result in an `Unauthorized` response.
- Forgetting to include the `X-API-Key` header will also result in an `Unauthorized` response.

## Best Practices
- Use a secure method to store and retrieve the API key, such as environment variables or a secure key management system.
- Regularly rotate the API key to enhance security.
- Implement rate limiting or other security measures to prevent brute-force attacks on the authentication endpoint.
