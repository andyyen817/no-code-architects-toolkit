# `/v1/toolkit/authenticate` API Documentation

## Overview
This endpoint is used to authenticate a client by verifying the provided API key. It serves as a gatekeeper, allowing access to other endpoints or resources only if the correct API key is provided.

## Endpoint
**URL Path:** `/v1/toolkit/authenticate`
**HTTP Method:** `GET`

## Request

### Headers
- `X-API-Key` (required): The API key used for authentication.

### Body Parameters
This endpoint does not require any request body parameters.

### Example Request
```
curl -X GET -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" http://your-domain.com/v1/toolkit/authenticate
```

## Response

### Success Response
**Status Code:** `200 OK`
**Response Body:**
```json
"Authorized"
```

### Error Responses
**Status Code:** `401 Unauthorized`
**Response Body:**
```json
"Unauthorized"
```

## Error Handling
If the provided `X-API-Key` header does not match the expected API key, the endpoint will return a `401 Unauthorized` status code with the response body `"Unauthorized"`.

## Usage Notes
- This endpoint should be called before accessing any other protected endpoints or resources to ensure proper authentication.
- The API key should be kept secure and not shared with unauthorized parties.

## Common Issues
- Providing an incorrect or invalid API key will result in an `Unauthorized` response.
- Forgetting to include the `X-API-Key` header in the request will also result in an `Unauthorized` response.

## Best Practices
- Use a secure method to store and retrieve the API key, such as environment variables or a secure key management system.
- Regularly rotate or update the API key to enhance security.
- Implement rate limiting or other security measures to prevent brute-force attacks or API abuse.
