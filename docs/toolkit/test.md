## Error Handling
If an exception occurs during the execution of the endpoint, a `500 Internal Server Error` status code is returned, along with the error message as the response body.

## Usage Notes
- This endpoint is primarily used for testing and verification purposes.
- It requires authentication, which is handled by the `@authenticate` decorator.
- The task is queued for asynchronous execution using the `@queue_task_wrapper` decorator.

## Common Issues
- Authentication issues: Ensure that a valid access token is provided in the `Authorization` header.
- Cloud storage connectivity issues: If the cloud storage service is unavailable or encounters an error, the endpoint may fail to upload the file and return an error.

## Best Practices
- Use this endpoint during the initial setup and deployment of the NCA Toolkit API to verify that the API is functioning correctly.
- Monitor the logs for any errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of this endpoint.
- Ensure that the necessary permissions and configurations are in place for the API to access the cloud storage service.
