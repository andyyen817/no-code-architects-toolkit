## Best Practices
- Ensure that the video URLs provided are accessible and valid.
- Consider providing a `webhook_url` to receive notifications about the status of the video combination process.
- Provide an `id` parameter to easily identify and track the request.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate error messages to users.
