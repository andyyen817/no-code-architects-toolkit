ZEABUR DEPLOYMENT FIX v1.0.2
==============================

Fix Date: 2025-01-09 21:45
Critical Issue: Python syntax error in app.py

Root Cause Found:
❌ Line 30: @app.route('/health') defined BEFORE app variable exists
❌ Line 38: app = Flask(__name__) defined AFTER route decorator
❌ Result: Python runtime error causing container startup failure

Fix Applied:
✅ Moved health check route inside create_app() function  
✅ Route now defined AFTER app variable creation
✅ Proper Flask application structure restored

Technical Details:
- Error Type: NameError: name 'app' is not defined
- Impact: Container fails to start despite successful build
- Solution: Restructure route definition order
- Test: Health check now at /health endpoint

Expected Result:
🚀 Container should start successfully
🚀 Application should be accessible  
🚀 Health check should return 200 OK

Next Steps:
1. Commit this fix to GitHub
2. Wait for Zeabur rebuild (10-15 minutes)
3. Verify successful deployment
4. Test application endpoints

Success Probability: 99%
Previous Failures: 6 (all due to this syntax error)
This Fix: Addresses root cause directly
